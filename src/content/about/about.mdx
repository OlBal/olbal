Hello, I'm Oliver Ballon and I am a full stack developer in Bristol, UK.

<br />
After studying graphic design and working for some of the most forward thinking studios
in London I moved back to Bristol, looking for a way to progress my career and breath
some new life into my skillset.
<br />
<br />
Tech being one of the most exciting industries that is currently driving
progress in the world and the way we interact with each other, so I naturally
gravitated towards it. Once I had made the decision I signed up for a coding
career accelerator called DevelopMe_ and the rest is history.
<br />
<br />
If I'm not building things in code you can find me behind an easel making paintings
or curled up with a good book.
